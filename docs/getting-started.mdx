# Getting Started

This section will walk you through the main features of `re-reduced` with practical examples:

In the following examples we'll be building a simple counter app.

## Defining a type system

`[root]/examples/Counter/types.ts`

```ts
export interface State {
  counter: number;
}
```

## Creating Actions

`[root]/examples/Counter/actions.ts`

```ts
import { createAction } from "re-reduced";

export default {
  adjust: createAction<number>("ADJUST"),
  decrement: createAction("DECREMENT"),
  increment: createAction("INCREMENT"),
};
```

alternatively, actions can be created in bulk using `createActions`

> Note that, when using createActions, the action type is infered from the action name and namespace

```ts
import { createActions } from "re-reduced";

export default createActions("COUNTER", create => ({
  adjust: create.action<number>(),
  decrement: create.action(),
  increment: create.action(),
}));
```

## Creating Reducers

`[root]/examples/Counter/reducers.ts`

```ts
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { createReducer, match } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";
import { State } from "./types";

const INITIAL_STATE = 0;

export const counter = createReducer<number>(
  [
    actions.increment.reduce(state => state + 1),
    actions.decrement.reduce(state => state - 1),
    actions.adjust.reduce((state, payload) => state + payload),
  ],
  INITIAL_STATE
);

// which can also be written like:

export const counter = createReducer<number>(
  [
    match(actions.increment, state => state + 1),
    match(actions.decrement, state => state - 1),
    match(actions.adjust, (state, payload) => state + payload),
  ],
  INITIAL_STATE
);

export default combineReducers<State>({
  counter,
});
```

## Creating selectors

`Selectors` in redux are functions defined in terms of the application state and perform `derivation` and `aggregation`.

> [`reselect`](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) is the recommended library for selector composition.

```ts
import { createSelector } from "reselect";

import { State } from "./types";

export const getCounter = (state: State) => state.counter;

export const getCounterIsOdd = createSelector(
  getCounter,
  counter => counter % 2 !== 0
);

export const getCounterIsPositive = createSelector(
  getCounter,
  counter => counter >= 0
);
```

## Connecting a component

Re-reduced provides the `connectWithActions` helper function for easily connecting state and actions to a component.

`[root]/src/ui/containers/Counter.tsx`

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { connectWithActions } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";
import * as selectors from "./selectors";

interface Props {
  count: number;
  isOdd: boolean;
  isPositive: boolean;
  actions: typeof actions;
}

const Counter = (props: Props) => (
  <section>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.decrement()}>-1</button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(-5)}>-5</button>
    <button
      disabled
      style={{
        color: props.isPositive ? (props.isOdd ? "blue" : "green") : "red",
        fontWeight: "bold",
        paddingLeft: 5,
        paddingRight: 5,
        width: 50,
      }}
    >
      {props.count}
    </button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(5)}>+5</button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.increment()}>+1</button>
  </section>
);

const enhance = connectWithActions<Props>(actions, {
  count: selectors.getCounter,
  isOdd: selectors.getCounterIsOdd,
  isPositive: selectors.getCounterIsPositive,
});

export default enhance(Counter);
```

> Note that `connectWithActions` does not provide 100% feature parity with [react-redux's](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) [connect](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start#connect).

The above `enhance` example can be easily rewritten without `connectWithActions`, using `connect`, `applySpec` and `bindActionCreators`.

```ts
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { applySpec } from "ramda";

const enhance = connect(
  applySpec({
    count: selectors.getCounter,
    isOdd: selectors.getCounterIsOdd,
    isPositive: selectors.getCounterIsPositive,
  }),
  dispatch => ({
    actions: bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch),
  })
);
```

Alternatively, from version `1.5.0`, re-reduced supports hooks, using the following syntax:

```tsx
import { useActions, useReduxState } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";
import * as selectors from "./selectors";

function Counter() {
  const { decrement, increment, adjust } = useActions(actions);
  const { count, isOdd, isPositive } = useReduxState({
    count: selectors.getCounter,
    isOdd: selectors.getCounterIsOdd,
    isPositive: selectors.getCounterIsPositive,
  });

  return <div>{/* app render logic... */}</div>;
}
```

## Demo

import { Playground } from "docz";

import Counter from "../examples/Counter";

<Playground>
  <Counter />
